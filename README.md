VoxelizedRenderer
=================

Simple uniform grid voxel renderer with OpenCL, written in C#.

Current features are just a slow rendering process of 1000 voxels depth and a moveable
camera.

22.03.2014: Ported project to the new OpenCL wrapper project (usage of new vector classes).

Controls:
WASD:		move
Arrow Keys: look around
